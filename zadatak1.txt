Which will generate: "Hello, world! Want a cookie?" or "Planet, I say hello. Want a cookie?"

This is a job to parse this syntax and output x number of generated results.

It should also create mispellings, with transpositions, common keyboard shifts, or doubled or missing characters.

It should be a command line program, e.g.

generateTexts infile blockNum count mispellingRatio

the infile could have many of these blocks (which we call recipes) enclosed in {braces}. So if the file had 100 recipes, you could output 6 result based on the 49th recipe. And on averge, 1 out of 10 words should have a mispelling: generateTexts myrecipes.txt 49 6 0.1
